Looks like you were trying to go to: <code><span id="desired-404"></span></code>.

## I dont't know where that is! :confused: :sad:

I've linked the top-level sections of the site; if you still can't find what
you're looking for, drop John a line â€“ [/contact](/contact). :smiley:

<script type="text/javascript">
  let url = window.document.URL;
  document.getElementById("desired-404").innerHTML = url;
</script>
