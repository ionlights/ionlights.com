# My "Story"
You'll find me solving problems with machine learning, researching immersive
realities and eeg signal processing, but most importantly, teaching.

I've spent the last few years studying computer science and applied mathematics
(computational / economics), among other topics. During that time, a few
startups spawned and a handful of professors were willing to advise me in
projects exploring topics like data mining, immersive reality, and signal
processing \[bioacoustic, electroencephalographic\], among others. Outside of
coursework and research, I've been teaching at local meetups and clubs
about a variety of topics in machine learning, especially applied to natural
language processing and non-supervised methods.

Head on over to my [/now](/now) page; I update that far more frequently.
(Don't know what a `/now` page is? [Lookie lookie](https://nownownow.com/about),
it's an awesome concept. :smiley)

[GitHub Pages][ghpages] serves my static site, hosted [here][repo]; they also
provide TLS certificates through [Let's Encrypt][letsencrypt].

Design is largely my own (I think, don't know exactly where inspirations come
from :stuck_out_tongue:), however I am using [Twitter Bootstrap][twbs] as the
layout framework and icons are hosted by [FontAwesome][fa].
