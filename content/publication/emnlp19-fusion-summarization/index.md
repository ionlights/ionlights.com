  Sentence fusion remains a challenging task for summarization systems. Multiple
  compatible sentences must be selected, then important content must be
  extracted from those sentences, and finally the content must be merged 
  together into a natural language sentence. In this paper, we analyze the
  outputs of five state-of-the-art neural abstractive summarizers, focusing on
  summary sentences that are formed by sentence fusion. We find that system 
  sentences are mostly grammatical, but often fail to remain faithful to the 
  original article. Additionally, we propose a new framework for generating 
  summary sentences that divides sub-tasks between two models: one which selects
  sentences and highlights words and phrases within those sentences, and the
  other generates a sentence using the previous modelâ€™s outputs as supplementary
  information. We achieve promising results using this distribution of tasks,
  which allows the generation model to better focus on fusing sentences
  effectively.

# on a daily basis to make decisions and learn new happenings. However,
