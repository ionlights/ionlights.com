  Fusing sentences containing disparate content is a remarkable human ability
  that helps create informative and succinct summaries. Such a simple task for
  humans has remained challenging for modern abstractive summarizers,
  substantially restricting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this
  paper, we present an investigation into fusing sentences drawn from a document
  by introducing the notion of points of correspondence, which are cohesive
  devices that tie any two sentences together into a coherent text. The types of
  points of correspondence are delineated by text cohesion theory, covering
  pronominal and nominal referencing, repetition and beyond. We create a dataset
  containing the documents, source and fusion sentences, and human annotations
  of points of correspondence between sentences. Our dataset bridges the gap
  between coreference resolution and summarization. It will be shared publicly
  to serve as a basis for future work to measure the success of sentence fusion
  systems.

  A new framework for generating summaries which stay true to their source
  sentences.

# Summarizing documents is a challenging, but necessary, task. We use summaries
# on a daily basis to make decisions and learn new happenings. However, 
# summarization is challenging for humans and more so for machines. **We
