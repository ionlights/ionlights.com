:wave: I'm John. Currently, I'm a visiting researcher at MIT working in 
computational cognitive science. Broadly, I'm interested in social cognition,
common sense reasoning, and psycholinguistics. For more recent info, check out
[now](/now/latest/). 

Previously, I've worked in Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Virtual
Reality, Brain Computer Interfaces, and Digital Signal Processing. However, I'm
most familiar with NLP and CV, as they're my most recent fields. 

It's worth noting, though, I'm always down to chat with people interested in
getting into research, especially the above fields, so feel free to [shoot me an
email through mycontact form][contact].
