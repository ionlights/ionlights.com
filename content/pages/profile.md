## Briefly

:wave: I'm John. I'm a pretty big fan of emojis, an avid cyclist, frequent
soccer player, and find joy in good books. 

I studied Computer Science, Mathematics, Robotics, and Cognitive Science during
undergrad, which I did at the [University of Central Florida (UCF)][ucf.edu].
While I was there, I explored startups and research, the latter being of greater
intrigue. Additionally, while at UCF, I co-founded a continually budding 
organization &ndash; [AI@UCF][ucfai] and finished off my last year with an 
invitation to MIT's Summer Program in Neuroscience with a return offer to spend 
a semester there as well. 

## AI@UCF
Probably the crowning achievement of my time in undergrad. This club started as
a way for some friends and I to reinforce our understanding of Machine Learning
(ML), Cognitive Science (CS), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) by teaching our
learnings to others. Ultimately, it's grown beyond that to encompass a
developing curriculum which continues to be refined and seeks to bring
non-computational folk "into the fold" all while fostering a community actively
engaged in both discussions and research focused on topics in AI/ML/CS.

Since graduating, I've been an advisor to the educational component, working to
give back to AI@UCF by broadening the scope of the materials covered so that
students can widen their perspective prior to graduation. Ideally, this widening
prepares them for the leap to graduate school in a discipline they truly enjoy,
as opposed to picking something subpar.

## MIT MSRP & Beyond
During the summer of 2019, I spent 4 months at MIT working with world-class
researchers (both senior to me and as peers). During that time, I began fleshing
out my passion for using tools from Computer Science to answer questions from
Cognitive Science and Sociology.

My interests are in computational cognition, particularly the **social**,
**common sense**, and **linguistic** kind. I build upon on our understanding of
cognitive science, particularly development, to develop models that mimic
external human behavior with the goal of advancing our understanding of these
kinds of cognition and the developmental mechanisms that give rise to these
abilities.
