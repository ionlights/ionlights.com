This past year, I worked with an awesome team to re-initialize the presence of
AI at uni. We're keeping it going next year, but in this post, I'll reflect on
some lessons learned by doing this.

## Background

[ACM][acm] (The Association for Computing Machinery) has SIGs (Special Interest
Groups), these SIGs are tailored towards a number of topics, including
Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, and Human-Computer
Interaction, among many others. Previously, we had SIGAI, but it wasn't sparking
interest in most people, and we set out to change that.

In that time, we managed to secure sponsorships from the likes of Intel and the
Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines; both are which are awesome sponsors to
have &ndash; we're looking to expand sponsorships so please let us know if
you're interested.

## The Fall Semester

Because we were trying something new, especially for us, we started out
relatively small and covered three distinct units: (0) Neural Networks, (1)
Reinforcement Learning, and (2) "Advanced Topics."

### Unit 0: Neural Networks

Although this wasn't my first time lecturing on a topic to crowds of up to 80
people, this was my first time doing anything related to machine learning (more
broadly, AI). One of the hallmarks of SIGAI is that we want to break down
intuitions (hybrids of our own and that of other's) such that we can convey them
to the students.
