This past year, I worked with a brand new group of people to grow the presence
of AI at uni. Looking ahead to next year is exciting, but I'll take some time to
reflect on the passed year.

## Background

This was my 2<sup>nd</sup> year running the student organization. While it may
seem a wee totalitarian, the intent was to formulate a vision and assemble a
lasting framework to keep the organization strong once I graduate.

This year, we kept on with our sponsorships, but focused much more on growing
membership and refining ["Core"][ucfai-core]. This "course" is probably one of
our most notable accomplishments among the team. As [UCF's][ucf] undergrad
coursework in "AI" is pretty dated, we found it necessary to formalize our own
curriculum to expand the horizons of incoming students.

**NOTE:** The key issue with UCF's "AI" coursework is less that it covers old
concepts and notions, but rather that it fails to set expectations accordingly.
Most students who come in to the official "Intro to AI" course leave not wanting
to expand their understanding of the field. While, ["Core"][ucfai-core] has an
extremely high retention rate, and generally fosters a curiosity among attending
students -- even driving some to pursue research.

## The Fall Semester

Because we were trying something new, especially for us, we started out
relatively small and covered three distinct units: (0) Neural Networks, (1)
Reinforcement Learning, and (2) "Advanced Topics."

### Unit 0: Neural Networks

Although this wasn't my first time lecturing on a topic to crowds of up to 80
people, this was my first time doing anything related to machine learning (more
broadly, AI). One of the hallmarks of SIGAI is that we want to break down
intuitions (hybrids of our own and that of other's) such that we can convey them
to the students.
