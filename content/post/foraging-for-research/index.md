## Some ramblings, well, maybe a bit more than a few. :sweat_smile:

So... science is amazing. At least that's what most of us think until about
5th grade. :confused: A possible reason many of us begin to lose the wonder of
science is due the way the US educational system works, but that's another rant
for another day.

Let's instead, consider a more obvious problem. Scientific communicators are
rare. So rare, that reading well-written papers and lectures, or hearing
articulate speakers on science, is astonishing (and they tend to reap said
benefits through celebrity-esque status). Well, at least, that's been my
experience over the last few years &ndash; getting into research, listening to
giants in their fields, and reading just about anything that sounds interesting.

Ultimately, this rarity **is a problem.** Science has given us a common ground,
facts about our universe that we can share with others, regardless of culture or
location. When that science, though, is out of the reach of understanding o
most of the world, given their educational backgrounds... that removes the
**_common_** from "common ground."

Now, that's not to say that science shall never be understandable by the masses,
but rather to say that we, as researchers, do a terrible job of communicating
our ideas, findings, and goals. This is potentially due to a number of factors,
including the enforcement of "publish or perish" and related "goals" in academia
&ndash;  making it challenging to teach, research, **_and_** communicate;
especially considering each one of those hats are akin to Lincoln's top-hat.

All of this rambling led me (and a few friends) to a conclusion of trying to
make research easier to understand for the masses, and particularly reducing
the standard deviation on conclusions drawn by the masses, is extremely
important. This spawned [forage][forage]. (As of this post the site isn't live,
but I'll update when it is.)

## Forage? Are we dumpster diving?

Well... **_you're not_**, but the team and I definitely are. Ultimately, the end
product is still in the works, but imagine a visualization of research, its
interconnectedness, as well as a means of information consumption that doesn't
involve digging for earthworms. That ought to be informative, yet vague enough.
:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

The name largely came from the fact that during our (team/self) time reading
research papers and developing an understanding, if felt like actually diving
into dumpsters, without many helpful resources, especially because we ourselves
couldn't quite formulate what we're looking for â€“ consider when you're picking
up something for the first time, and you **_really_** don't know what you don't
know and trying to seek out help. Typically it just ends with two rather annoyed
people. :confused:
