title: "100 Days of Cognitive Science"
summary: >-
  A mix of trying to maintain COVID-19 sanity, a desire to further explore
  CogSci before grad school, and a drive to document my journey from CS
  (Computer Science) into CS (Cognitive Science).

## Motivation

Computer Science and it's subfields have always been where my interests lie;
but they make much more sense as tools than they do as ends &ndash; at least
for my particular interests, which are cognition of the social, linguistic, and
common-sense variety.

This project is documenting my further exploration into each of these areas of
Cognition, for grad school, and beyond.
