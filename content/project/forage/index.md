title: "Forage"
summary: >-
  Cutting edge science shouldn't require highly advanced degrees to make 
  heads-or-tails of it. Forage is a summarization and visualization tool to make
  understanding much more straightforward.

Forage was born out of a frustration with getting into research as an undergrad.
Our host institution didn't quite have research which truly interested us, but
more importantly, this discovery required an extreme number of hours effectively
"grasping in the dark" hoping that we might develop _just enough_ intuition to
inform future searches.

While we learned in our fields of interest, we also built Forage. A platform
which visualizes research connections and strives to summarize all academic
research, accurately, to enable more quicker knowledge acquisition and discovery
of key ideas, thus accelerating the development of intuition about a given field.
