title: Forage
summary: >-
  Cutting edge science shouldn't require highly advanced degrees to make 
  heads-or-tails of it. Forage is a summarization and visualization tool to make
  understanding much more straightforward.

> Reading research is a risk. Let Forage guide you.

Forage was born out of a frustration with getting into research as an undergrad.
Our host institution didn't quite have research that truly interested us, but
more importantly, this discovery required an extreme number of hours of 
"grasping in the dark" hoping that we might develop _just enough_ intuition to
inform future searches.

While we have learned much since then, we set out to build Forage. A tool that
visualizes research connectivity, strives to summarize academic research
accurately, and works to enhance a reader's ability to understand singular
texts without scurrying down the rabbit hole of references. 

Ultimately, we hope that Forage can service at least two groups:
1. Up-and-coming students who are considering/pursuing researchers.
1. Current researchers seek to gain knowledge outside of their field, or
   generally consume academic content more quickly.
