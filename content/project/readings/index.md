## Motivation

Computer Science and it's subfields have always been where my interests lie;
but they make much more sense as tools than they do as ends &ndash; at least
for my particular interests, which are cognition of the social, linguistic, and
common-sense variety.

This project is documenting my further exploration into each of these areas of
Cognition, for grad school, and beyond.
