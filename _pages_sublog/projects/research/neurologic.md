    Electroencephalography is a pretty old field, but brain-computing interfaces
    aren't nearly so old. They're also logical to be the next form of human-
    computer interaction; working with Dr. Paris, research projects span signal-
    processing, machine learning, and neuroscience, trying to develop more
    accurate models of what's going on in everyone's 1.5kg mush pile.
