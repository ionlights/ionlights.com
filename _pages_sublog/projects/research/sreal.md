    Synthetic Realities are only just beginning (really they started in the 
    1960s), but soon it'll be difficult to distinuish real from virtual (for 
    better or worse). :confused: Regardless, working with Dr. Hughes and many 
    others, we're making progress on increasing that realism through better
    understanding of what body-ownership means.
