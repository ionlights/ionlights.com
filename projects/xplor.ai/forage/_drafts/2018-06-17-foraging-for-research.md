title: Foraging for Research
snark: Dumpster Diving for Papers

Research can be a bit of a bore. Especially when trying to track down papers.
This is a noob's attempt at trying to up-end the current way you find these
knowledge-laiden documents and also work towards removing the need for a
5-year PhD in theoretical physics to undertstand their contents.

## Some ramblings, well, maybe a bit more than a few. :stuck_out_tongue:
So... science is amazing. At least that's what most of us think until about 
5th grade. :confused: A possible reason many of us begin to lose the wonder of
science is due the way education works, but that's another rant for another day.

Let's instead, consider the a more obvious problem. Scientific communicators are
rare. So rare, that reading well-written papers and lectures, or hearing 
articulate speakers on science, is astonishing. Well, at least, that's been my 
experience over the last few years &ndash; getting into research, listening to 
giants in their fields, and reading just about anything that sounds interesting.
**This is a problem.** Science has given us a common ground, facts about our 
universe that we can share with others, regardless of culture or geolocation.
When that science, though, is out of the reach of understanding of most of the 
world, given their educational backgrounds... that removes the **_common_** from
"common ground." 

Now, that's not to say that science shall never be understandable by the masses,
but rather to say that we, as researchers, do a terrible job of communicating our
ideas, findings, and goals. This is due to a number of factors, including the 
idea of "publish or perish" and related things in academia, which makes it 
challenging to teach, research, and communicate &ndash; and is really only a set 
of hats wearable by a very small subset of us.

All of this rambling led me (and a few friends) to a conclusion of trying to make
research easier to understand for the masses, and particularly reducing the 
standard deviation on conclusions drawn by the masses. Basically, this is going 
to result in producing [forage][forage]. (As of 17 Jun, 2018 this site isn't 
live, will update the post when it is though.)

## Forage, are we dumpster diving?
Well... **_you're not_**, but the team and I definitely are. Have you ever 
tried doing anything with PDFs? It's atrocious, but that's what we get for 
trying to use a document format built for printing to tell us what it's contents
are. :confused: :joy: (I might do a post about this later on, if anyone wants.)
As for what Forage is, well... that's goin'a stay under wraps for a little while
longer, but imagine a visualization of research, it's interconnectedness, as 
well as a means of information consumption that doesn't involve digging for 
earthworms. That ought to be informative, yet vague enough. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
