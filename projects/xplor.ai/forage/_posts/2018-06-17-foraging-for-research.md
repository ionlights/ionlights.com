Research can be a bit of a bore. Especially when trying to track down papers.
This is a noob's attempt at trying to up-end the current way you find these
knowledge-laiden documents and also work towards removing the need for a
5-year PhD in theoretical physics to understand its contents.

## Some ramblings, well, maybe a bit more than a few. :stuck_out_tongue:
So... science is amazing. At least that's what most of us think until about 
5th grade. :confused: A possible reason many of us begin to lose the wonder of
science is due the way the US educational system works, but that's another rant 
for another day.

Let's instead, consider a more obvious problem. Scientific communicators are rare. 
So rare, that reading well-written papers and lectures, or hearing articulate 
speakers on science, is astonishing (and they tend to reap said benefits through 
celebrity-esque status). Well, at least, that's been my experience over the last 
few years &ndash; getting into research, listening to giants in their fields, and 
reading just about anything that sounds interesting. 

Ultimately, this rarity **is a problem.** Science has given us a common ground, 
facts about our universe that we can share with others, regardless of culture or 
location. When that science, though, is out of the reach of understanding of most 
of the world, given their educational backgrounds... that removes the **_common_** 
from "common ground." 

Now, that's not to say that science shall never be understandable by the masses,
but rather to say that we, as researchers, do a terrible job of communicating our
ideas, findings, and goals. This is potentially due to a number of factors, 
including the enforcement of "publish or perish" and related "goals" in academia 
&ndash;  making it challenging to teach, research, **_and_** communicate; especially 
considering each one of those hats are akin to Lincoln's top-hat.

All of this rambling led me (and a few friends) to a conclusion of trying to 
make research easier to understand for the masses, and particularly reducing 
the standard deviation on conclusions drawn by the masses, is extremely important.
This spawned [forage][forage]. (As of this post the site isn't live, 
but I'll update when it is.)

## Forage? Are we dumpster diving?
Well... **_you're not_**, but the team and I definitely are. Ultimately, the end 
product is still in the works, but imagine a visualization of research, its 
interconnectedness, as well as a means of information consumption that doesn't 
involve digging for earthworms. That ought to be informative, yet vague enough. 
:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

The name largely came from the fact that during our (team/self) time reading 
research papers and developing an understanding, if felt like actually diving into
dumpsters, without many helpful resources, especially because we ourselves couldn't
quite formulate what we're looking for â€“ consider when you're picking up something
for the first time, and you **_really_** don't know what you don't know and trying 
to seek out help. Typically it just ends with two rather annoyed people. :confused:s
