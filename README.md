:wave: I'm **John**, a researcher in Harvard's Department of Psychology and
MIT's Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines.

My interests are in computational cognition, particularly the **social**,
**common sense**, and **linguistic** kind. I build upon on our understanding of
cognitive science, particularly development, to develop models that mimic
external human behavior with the goal of advancing our understanding of these
kinds of cognition and the developmental mechanisms that give rise to these
abilities.
