# Contact Policy
I'm always happy to talk to [strangers][making-friends]; however, please consider my inbox before reaching out.

I **_will not reply_** if you're sending me (1) **recruiting emails** or (2) **requesting debug help**. (For debugging, _google-fu_ will serve you well.)

If you're still reading this, dope. I'm ready and willing to reply to...
- questions/issues/ideas about my papers, blog posts, projects (code+like), and
  things of that nature
- questions about research, career planning, etc.
- questions about getting started in fields like...
  - natural language processing (nlp)
  - machine learning (ml)
  - virtual reality (vr)
  - haptics
  - digitial signal processing (dsp)
  - electroencephalography (eegs)

**NOTE:** For your email to reach me, it must have `[ionlights.com]` in the subject line, at the beginning. If it doesn't, it's almost guaranteed I won't see it.
